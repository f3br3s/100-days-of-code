# 100 Days Of Code - Log -Eduardo Febres

### Day 0: April 23rd, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I built a slick slider snippet from scratch to understand how it works and the classes it uses. I set up my 100-days-of-code repository.

**Thoughts**: I struggled a litlle to find out how to comment a markdown file.

### Day 1: April 24rd, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I placed the responsive slider and the responsive logo on the same container and they work toghether well. I still have to fix the vertical margins in medium sizes, and disable the slider in small sizes. I also have to synch an empty slide with a query that hides and shows the responsive logo background.

**Thoughts**: Even though I think my javascript knwoledge is near zero, I felt very confident customizing the responsive slider.

### Day 2: April 25st, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I struggled trying to manipulate with jquery the classes I used to make my logo responsive (using background image position and size and svg file) to make it appear and dissapear in synch with an empty slide of the slick slider. Didn't make any progress but learned some jquery sintax and workarounds. I didn't stop until I found this [solution to loop addClass and removeClass] with jquery. Hopefully I'll have my responsive slider + responsive logo header done by tomorrow.

### Day 3: April 26th, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I kept struggling to make a background image change in a loop, to achieve the responsive logo + responsive slider header. Didn't make it yet but already found a script (in pure java script, no library) to change a background image in a loop. I made the test with a svg  file and it worked. I think tomorrow I'll just have to synch the background image (with the responsive logo) and the slider and move on to the next challenge.

### Day 4: April 27th, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Finally made it! Roughly but made it: I have a slick slider and a responsive logo on the same header. It was hard to synch the slider animation script and the toggle background image animation script, and I tried some others approaches (like covering the background responsive logo with a slide background color, or putting the responsive logo background-based on a slider container). None of them worked, so I try harder to synch the slider and the background image toggle, and finally made it. 

**Thoughts**: It's not even close a perfect solution. But I'm proud of how far have I go without learning more than really really basic javascript. I'll learn some more on the 100Days challenge, though, and I think that after this work everything will be easier there.
