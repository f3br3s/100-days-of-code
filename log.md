# 100 Days Of Code - Log -Eduardo Febres

### Day 0: April 23rd, 2019 (Example 1)
**Today's Progress**: I built a slick slider snippet from scratch to understand how it works and the classes it uses. I set up my 100-days-of-code repository.

**Thoughts**: I struggled a litlle to find out how to comment a markdown file.

**Link to work**: [Slick slider snippet]
