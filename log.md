# 100 Days Of Code - Log -Eduardo Febres

### Day 0: April 23rd, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I built a slick slider snippet from scratch to understand how it works and the classes it uses. I set up my 100-days-of-code repository.

**Thoughts**: I struggled a litlle to find out how to comment a markdown file.

### Day 1: April 24rd, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I placed the responsive slider and the responsive logo on the same container and they work toghether well. I still have to fix the vertical margins in medium sizes, and disable the slider in small sizes. I also have to synch an empty slide with a query that hides and shows the responsive logo background.

**Thoughts**: Even though I think my javascript knwoledge is near zero, I felt very confident customizing the responsive slider.
